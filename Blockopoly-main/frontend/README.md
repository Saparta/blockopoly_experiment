### Connecting to the Example Backend

To try the multiplayer room functionality, first start the backend server in `../backend`. The frontend can then join a room by sending a `POST` request to `/create-room` and connecting to the Socket.IO gateway at the same host. This README does not include a full implementation, but the backend server demonstrates how rooms are managed.
